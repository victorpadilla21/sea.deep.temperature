STATISTICAL SOFTWARE:R and SAS - Laboratory with R for sea water temperature analysis (MESIO UPC-UB)

The repository aims to contribute to the study of climate change by providing metrics and analysis on data of the sea water temperatures, mainly ranging from 2000 up to 2023.

This repository contains an R script for the analysis and plotting of data and data analysis related to the sea water temperature in Medes islands in the catalan coast at several depths (0, -20, -50, -80 metres). 

This repository contains 2 csv files. One file belonging to the temperature data from https://www.idescat.cat/indicadors/?id=aec&n=15196&t=200000 and another additional file belonging to a dataset for cross-validation retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data.

The data belonging to Medes islands has been retrieved from https://www.idescat.cat/indicadors/?id=aec&n=15196&t=200000. Source: Departament d'Acció Climàtica, Alimentació i Agenda Rural. Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya. Note: Observation point: l'Estartit (1 mile east of the Medes islands), Sr. Josep Pascual. Coordinates: 42º 03' N, 3º 15' E.

All credits for the cross-validation data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data belongs to their respective authors (Berkely Earth, affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). The cross-validation data had been measured at diverse sites.

In addition, the repository contains 2 R packages: forecast for the prediction of the sea water temperatures at Medes islands based on the data retrieved from https://www.idescat.cat/indicadors/?id=aec&n=15196&t=200000.
